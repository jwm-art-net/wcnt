************************************************************************

wcnt is now dependant on libsndfile - please make sure you have the
current stable version installed (development packages if not compiling
libsndfile from source).

wcnt now has several modules which interface with selected LADSPA
plugins. the modules will compile and be available even if the plugins
are not, but if used when the plugins are unavailable then wcnt will
complain and refuse to proceed any further.

wcnt will look for LADSPA plugins in /usr/local/lib/ladspa/ and
/usr/lib/ladspa/. If LADSPA plugins are installed elsewhere on your
system, please ensure the LADSPA_PATH enviroment variable is set.
Usage of the LADSPA_PATH environment variable will override the
default location wcnt searches for plugins.

(only a very small percentage of these plugins can be used by wcnt).

************************************************************************
By default, wcnt is compiled with compiler optimizations and without
debuggin information.  Look in the top of the Makefile if you dislike this,
it will tell you what you must do to change it - it's very simple.

***** COMPILATION *****

There is no configure script. To compile wcnt simply type:

make

in the main wcnt directory.

You can also make the examples by typing:

make examples

in the main wcnt directory.  The wav's generated are located in the
examples directory along with the .wc files that generated them.

You cannot type make install to install wcnt anymore. You could try

su -c "install wcnt /usr/local/bin"

in the main wcnt directory.  Change the path if you do not want to install
there.  To uninstall, become super user, and type:

rm /usr/local/bin/wcnt

Finally, you can also:

make clean
make clean_examples

Please do email me at james@jwm-art.net if you have difficulties getting
wcnt to compile. If it crashes then please send me the .wc file(s) which
it happened to be processing at the time of the crash.

I have tested wcnt within Debian Etch on an AMD Athlon XP 3000, with
2GB of dodgy SDRAM :(

As a side note, make examples on my machine takes just under two and a half
minutes to generate 19 minutes worth of audio.
