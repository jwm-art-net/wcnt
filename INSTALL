By default, wcnt is compiled with compiler optimizations.  Look in the
top of the Makefile if you dislike them, or for debugging wcnt..

To compile wcnt simply type:

make

in the main wcnt directory.

You can also make the examples by typing:

make examples

in the main wcnt directory.  The wav's generated are located in the
examples directory along with the .wc files that generated them.

You cannot type make install to install wcnt anymore.  Instead, become
super user and type:

install wcnt /usr/local/bin

in the main wcnt directory.  Change the path if you do not want to install
there.  To uninstall, become super user, and type:

rm /usr/local/bin/wcnt

Finally, you can also:

make clean
make clean_examples

Please do email me at james@jwm-art.net if you have difficulties getting
wcnt to compile. If it crashes then please send me the .wc file(s) which
it happened to be processing at the time of the crash.

I have only tested it within Debian Sarge on a 1.6Ghz AMD Duron blah.
