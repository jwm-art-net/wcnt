wcnt - Wav Composer Not Toilet

wcnt is a command line not-real-time modular audio synthesis, sequencer, and sampler, written in C++ for Linux i386 based systems. wcnt reads plain text files written in wcnt's 'near english 
synth definition pseudo language' and may then produce audio as stereo WAV files.
