compile in the usual manner:

./configure
make
make install

type  wcnt   for  command line options
which will give you some limited help.
Some of which can be copied and pasted
into a wcnt file and edited.

there is also source code for a little
program which supposedly is meant to
help with finding values for note 
positions and lengths.  It allows you
to choose a quarter value suitable for
the type of riff you want to create, and
displays note positions/lengths through
a bar, and also, values for several bars.

To compile it type:

gcc lensel.cc -o lensel

to execute it type (from same directory)

./notesel

Be warned:  It does very little checking 
of user input.....
