Questions and Answers (it would be a FAQ, but no one asks!)

--------------------------------------------------------------
Q) Why are there no straight oscillators and LFOs?

	A) Because I split the oscillator up, between
	the part which calculates the frequency modulation
	etc, and the waveform.  This enables one osc_clock
	to drive multiple waveforms.  The LFO has been
	splitt as such, with a further division named
	lfo_controller.  This takes output of a waveform
	and then applies a ramp.
	
--------------------------------------------------------------
Q) What is this deg_step_size thing all about?

	A) deg_step_size is one of the outputs from osc_clock 
	and lfo_clock amongst others.  Waveforms in wcnt use 
	it to calculate how many degrees to step through on 
	each sample to create the waveform at the desired 
	frequency.
ie:
	frequency = 1 cycle per second
	samplerate = 44100
	deg_step_size = 1 / 44100 = 0.000022676

	frequency = 440 hrtz
	samplerate = 44100
	deg_step_size = 440 / 44100 = 0.009977324
	
--------------------------------------------------------------
Q) Would it not make more sense if the waveform etc took a 
   frequency and not deg_step_size?
   	
	A) Probably, but when you have one osc_clock feeding
	multiple waveforms, it's more efficient that the 
	osc_clock does the conversion to deg_step_size,
	rather than multiple waveforms all doing it.

Q) What's with your ADSRs?

	A) I wanted to be able to have multiple sectioned
	ADSRs which could also be modulated.  I hoped it
	would provide a bit of variation in the sound.  The
	sustain section is not user modifiable because it is
	set to the end level of the last decay section and
	stays at that level until note_off.   The upper part
	of the ADSR is the shape triggered by a high velocity
	(1.0), the lower adsr shape is triggered by a low
	velocity.  (it does not have to be a velocity though)
	The velocity input does not effect the amplitude of
	the adsr output.
	
--------------------------------------------------------------
Q) Why did you bother to write a not-real-time modular 
   synthesis program when there are much better ones out 
   there?
   
  	A) It's something I started long before I even knew
	of opensource etc, at a time when I was skint.  It is
	intended for people with computers too slow to do
	real time synthesis.  And after my turtle beach tropez+
	cracked up, I needed a way of playing samples at 
	different frequencies, with looping, and envelopes etc,
	something my Soundblaster Live! Value lacked.  wcnt may
	be lacking in many ways, but I do intend it to be
	usable. I also hope to offer a few unsual features, but
	don't quote me on that.
	
--------------------------------------------------------------
Q) Why have you not used libraries such as LADSPA etc?

	A) Because I learnt C++ off my own back to program
	wcnt.  I've never really got the hang of using other
	peoples code much, and besides there's still plenty
	of things I can write myself yet.  Once I've done that
	then maybe I'll investigate.
	
--------------------------------------------------------------
Q) Where are the effects?

	A) In your favorite audio editor.
	
--------------------------------------------------------------
Q) Why do the low and high pass filters slow everything down
   so much?
   
   A) Because I programmed them from scratch.  They use an
   array which is filled with input signal.  For every sample
   it tots up the values in the array and outputs the average.
   The lower the cutoff frequency, the greater the number of 
   samples to be averaged.  Advanced mathamatics is not my
   strong point.
