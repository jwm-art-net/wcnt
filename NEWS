-------------------------
New features in wcnt-1.25
-------------------------

* group
    * group modules together then the whole group can be copied.

* copier
    * copy single data objects and modules.

* peak_detector
    * output a message when the input signal falls outside a
      specified range.

* adder
    * add two signals together.

* subtracter
    * subtract a signal from another.

* simple_delay
    * a simple delay.

* trig_delay
    * delay a trigger.

* stepper
    * takes a step through a shape of values each time it 
      is triggered.


--------------------------
new features in wcnt-1.128
--------------------------
* time_map
    * tempo changes have been changed so that you add or
      subtract from the existing tempo, instead of specifiying
      an absolute value to set the bpm at.

* sequencer
    * new implimentation of note slide handling.  It now remembers
      notes to slide back to.
    * slight improvements made to time keeping code.
    * no longer provides out_end_trig when out_start_trig requested
    * removed a redundant parameter hold_notename

* adsr
    * release section can now only be triggered once. subsequent
      note_off triggers which occurr before a note_on have no effect.
    * min_time parameter, specifies minimum time adsr can run before
      note_off.
    * max_sustain_time, specifies maximum time sustain section can hold.
    * release_is_ratio (on/off) turns levels in release section to
      ratios.

* osc_clock
    * response_time parameter added.
    * in_play_state input added.  used in combination with response_time
      parameter. when in_play_state input is on, take n milliseconds to
      change frequency.  when in_play_state is off, ignore response_time.

* logic_trigger
    * new function - xornot. only trigger if trigger1 triggers, but not
      if trigger2 triggers simultaneously.
    * precision parameter added. tells the logic_trigger how many samples
      may elaspe between in_trig1 and in_trig2 triggering and still treat
      them as occurring simultaneously.

* sync_clock - new module
    * a LFO-like clock module which keeps in time with tempo via inputs
      connected to a time_map module.
    * quarter_value and note_length parameters specify how fast to tick.
    * phase can be reset.
    * can be connected to sine_wave module etc.
