wcnt-1.26.4

http://wcnt.sourceforge.net

some minor adjustments to features and a bug fixed:

    * param_editor
      aswell as editing parameters to completely new values
      (as it always has done) it can now add, subtract, divide
      or multiply existing values (for numeric parameters only).

    * LADSPA_PATH environment variable
      only needs to be set if LADSPA plugins are not installed
      in the path "/usr/local/lib/ladspa/:/usr/lib/ladspa/".

    * fixed logic of numeric parameters range checking code.
