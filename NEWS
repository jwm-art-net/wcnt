wcnt-1.26.3

http://wcnt.sourceforge.net

mainly a bug fix release:


    * removed bpm and time signature information from the 'header'
      part of a .wc file. this effects the time_map module.

    * fader module's output out_trig has become out_bar_trig to
      reflect it's input names and function.

    * removed display clutter from --data-object-help command 
      line option.

    * removed references to the non-existant cosine_wave module
      which had been causing problems for --input-help cmdline
      option.

    * can now read a .wc file which only contains a single
      wcnt_exit module without crashing. oi! oi!
