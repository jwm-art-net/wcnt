     The runt of the litter for command line
       modular audio synthesis in Linux!

After a break of five years from wcnt development
I took it up again - just in time to celebrate
wcnt's tenth anniversary. Intending simply to get
it building again on modern Linux systemts (3.10!)
something else happened instead...

    * Complete overhaul of the UI code for handling
      inputs and parameters to allow:
        * arbitrary ordering of items
        * optional items
        * optional groups of items
        * multiple choice items
        * self connection of optional inputs

    * Added descriptions of modules, data objects,
      inputs, outputs, and parameters for display
      by command line help.

    * New modules:
        * seq_echo      } these provide dedicated
        * seq_router    } routing of sequencer events
        * wcnt_note     }

    * Removed mono version of C* Plate plugin
    * Improved handling of LADSPA ports and
      validation of values specified for parameters
      (control ports in LADSPA terminology).

    * Removed pointless in_bar_trig from modules
      which used it to tell them when to check
      their bar number input (wavfile_out,
      serial_wavout, and fader modules).

    * Added time_is_relative parameter to toggle
      the interpretation of timings in the timer
      module.

    * Added recycle_mode parameter to timer to
      allow it to loop endlessly.

    * Added out_count output to pattern_trig to
      increment at each trigger output in the
      pattern - until the pattern starts over that
      is.

    * Changed the input/output/parameter names of
      the inspector module to perhaps make sense
      to those people who are not me.

    * Fixes for serial_wavout. say no more.

    * Fixes for fader to no longer ignore or
      forget about early fade-outs.

    * Added out_count output (a count of things)
      to fader to exist alongside out_bar output
      (a count of occurrences).

    * Fixed data object help.

    * Fixed sanity_checks to detect
      inconsistencies between set/get_param values
      like it was supposed to (and fixed the
      inconsistencies it found).

    * Removed compilation warnings

    * Fixes for compilation issues on modern
      systems.
