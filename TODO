TODO:

    * although parameters of modules and data objects can be edited, it
      is not currently possible to edit the parameters of data objects
      contained in a list.  a possible solution would be to create a
      specialised dobj for each dobj type. for example a riff_editor,
      or adsr_envelope_editor.  these would contain a list which
      specifies which objects to select, and then another list which
      specifies what to do with them. better would be a dobj_editor
      which would work on any dobj type.

    * controller module.  outputs a signal which can be ramped from a
      point in one bar, to another point in the same, or different bar.
      needs to be aware of bpm, time signature etc, in order to accomplish
      correct rampage.  I'm not sure if I correctly figured out that it is
      impossible in wcnt's current state.

    * figure out why set_wc_filename in synthfilereader gets reported as
      creating a memory leak by ccmalloc and valgrind memory profilers.

    * still not got any anti-aliasing on waveforms etc.
    * still not made those module variating auto generation features
    * still not made those sample data and sample mapping features
    * still not made those polyphany enabling modules.
    * still not using LADSPA
    * still not using secret rabbit code, libsndfile.
    * still not making lots of money, money, money, money, money, money..
