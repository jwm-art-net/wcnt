ok, forget all those dreams from last year...

the next item on the todo list is to remove the bpm and time signature
from the header. also, resist deleting the wcnt_exit module - because
if specifying the bar and output to use to exit became a part of the
header - it would be terrible (and let's just leave it at that).

maybe look into some of those horrible places at tidying/untangling
messy code... ( but where to start ;-)

-------------------------------------
TODO - 1st December 2007

/***** update: 31st January 2008
  this stuff here is definitely for the future, requires more thought...
*/////

i'm thinking about some  kind of thing, some kind of stuff...

something to parameters to be specified as optional by the module - so that
sensible values are chosen by the module. something to make groups of inputs
connect to corresponding groups of outputs - by specifying the module name
only...

something to choose the obvious output choice when connecting an input and
only the output module name is specified. something to choose the less
obvious choice when the output categories are the same amongst similiar
outputs (ie for tagging inputs/outputs as frequency, or amplitude etcetc).

something to provide as many input/parameter pairings for frequency
modulation as user requires (ie not limited to one or two pair).

something better to make certain types of modulation - more transparent
in their function. someway of choosing scale units (ie semitones or ratio
etc).

some of this may make it faster for the user to type out quickly, but then
it might make the program /even/ slower.


------------------------------------------
TODO:
    * Test it fully.

    * although parameters of modules and data objects can be edited, it
      is not currently possible to edit the parameters of data objects
      contained in a list.  a possible solution would be to create a
      specialised dobj for each dobj type. for example a riff_editor,
      or adsr_envelope_editor.  these would contain a list which
      specifies which objects to select, and then another list which
      specifies what to do with them. better would be a dobj_editor
      which would work on any dobj type.

    * controller module.  outputs a signal which can be ramped from a
      point in one bar, to another point in the same, or different bar.
      needs to be aware of bpm, time signature etc, in order to accomplish
      correct rampage.  I'm not sure if I correctly figured out that it is
      impossible in wcnt's current state.

    * still not got any anti-aliasing on waveforms etc.
    * still not made those module variating auto generation features
    * still not made those sample data and sample mapping features
    * still not made those polyphany enabling modules.
    * still not making lots of money, money, money, money, money, money..
