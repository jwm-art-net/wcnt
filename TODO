there are a few more modules I'd like to make

controller - like a very long envelope
trigdelay  - delay a trigger by n ms.
effects    - delay, chorus, echo, reverb, better filters, etc

And let's not forget a shiny spanky gui for one day in the distant future
when everyone else has written programs miles better than this.
