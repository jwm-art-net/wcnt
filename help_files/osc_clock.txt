Another module with a name which might mislead. The osc_clock is just a
clock, but it is supposed to be a clock which works like... For general
usage connect as follows:

in_note_on_trig:       connect to sequencer out_note_on_trig
in_note_slide_trig:    connect to sequencer out_note_slide_trig
in_play_state:         connect to adsr out_play_state (optional)
in_frequency:          connect to sequencer out_frequency

portamento_time is the time (ms) it takes (but only when
in_note_slide_trig triggers) for the frequency of the current note to
slide to the frequency of the new note. response_time is used when
in_play_state input receives an ON when in_note_on_trig triggers - ie
response_time is the number of ms for a normal note change (unless
in_play_state is off - in which case it will change instantly).
