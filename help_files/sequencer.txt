A monophonic sequencer with seperate trigger outputs for note on events
and note slide events (when notes overlap their pitch slides). Riffs of
notes are inserted at bar positions and can be transposed at the point
of insertion,  repeated across any number of bars, or repeatedly
inserted once every few bars.

The sequencer module's inputs should be connected to the time_map
module's similarly named outputs. Connecting the sequencer in any other
way is still untested to be honest.

The velocity_response_time parameter is the number of ms it takes for
each note's velocity to be ramped up to the new note's velocity. This
only affects out_velocity_ramp. out_velocity will output the note's
velocity as it is. You will want to use out_velocity_ramp if you use
one of the amp modules for velocity changes.

The start_bar parameter can be used to skip bars in the sequence so you
can quickly and easily hear how additional riffs will sound without
having to process the entire lot.
