The wave module generates oscillating waveforms. There are three basic
waveform types to choose from: sine, tri, and saw. These waveforms
output is within the -1.0 to 1.0 range. There are alternative versions
of these waveforms which will output the same shape but within the 0.0
to 1.0 range instead. There is also a waveform named one, and this will
only output the value 1.0, constantly unchanging.

in_phase_step should normally connect with an out_phase_step output
coming from one of the clock type modules.
