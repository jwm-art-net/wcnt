The square_wave is a very square square_wave with very sharp corners.

(See sine_wave or clock for description of what in_deg_size is.)

in_pwm is the square_wave's pulse width modulation input. The amount of
modulation is controlled by pwm_size, and the pulse_width parameter. For an
equally balanced square wave, the pulse width should be 0.5. pwm_size
should be between 0.0 and 0.9...

This waveform is not anti-aliased.
Output values alternate -1.0 and +1.0
