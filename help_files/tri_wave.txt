tri_wave - a triangle waveform generating module.

Much like the sine_wave it's best not to connect it's in_phase_trig at all.
You will definitely want to connect it's in_deg_size input to a clock module's
out_deg_size output, if you want a waveform to be generated. And, don't forget"
to set recycle_mode to on and zero_retrigger to off, in this case."
This waveform is not anti-aliased. Output values are between -1.0 and +1.0"
