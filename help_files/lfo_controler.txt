The name of the lfo_controller module is a little misleading. It does
not control, but shape a waveform (or anything else for that matter)
which could be used for modulation.

For normal behaviour, in_trig should connect to thesame trigger output
(for example sequencer out_note_on_trig) as the lfo_clock which drives
the waveform intended for modulation purposes.

The in_waveform takes the waveforms output and...

delay_time (ms) the time it takes after in_trig triggering for the ramp
time to begin.

start_level is a multiplier, it is the level used for controlling
output when in_trig triggers. It stays at this level until delay_time
ms have elapsed. 0.0 might be a recommended value.

ramp_time (ms) the time it takes for the output levels to assume the
full levels which in_waveform provides (if end_level is set to 1.0 that
is).

end_level is also a multiplier, it is the level attained at the end of
the ramp time.

response_time is the time in ms it takes for the current output
controlling level to be reset back to start_level when in_trig
triggers. This makes for a nice smooth transition...
