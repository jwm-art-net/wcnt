Announcing for the last time this year the new release of Wav Composer Not Toilet, or wcnt for short.  Wcnt is of course, the not-real-time modular synth, sequencer, sampler, wav file generator.

This release is wcnt-1.1z (read wcnt-1.1260) and here are the new features and changes:)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BIG CHANGES:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*** Sets of data which are not module parameters or module inputs (shape of an adsr, notes in a riff, riffs in a sequencer, etc) have now been generalised into a base class.  Specialised data reading routines have been replaced, which make it easier to create new data sets.  This also means that data definitions are now more tappy tappy on your keyboard, my justification for this extra user effort is readability.

*** Riffs inserted into sequencer can be transposed at point of insertion, and the note lengths can be modified.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
COMMAND LINE:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*** Now has short options too.

*** two conversion options to convert a note name to a frequency, and a frequency to degs per sample and samples per cycle.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NEW MODULES:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*** dynamic
	Maps amplitudes of input signal to a set of output amplitudes/ratios.  Of course it has two sets of which the output can be modulated between.

*** spreader
	Spreads the output of a number of wcnt_signal modules along an imaginary line and outputs that which the modulation input lands upon.

*** note_tran
	Translates notes into values.  The note range used depends on being triggered by a note_on, or note_slide.  Four output triggers so you can tell if the note was in one of the two note ranges or not.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MINOR CHANGES:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*** adsr got a couple new params regarding shape modulation

*** logic trigger's xor mode definately works now (dunno if it did before)

*** trigger now behaves in a note_on/note_off type operation gleaned from the input signal.

*** wcnt_signal has a level param

That's All Folks, same time next year, see ya!  see ya!  see ya.  see ya, see ya see yaseeyacyacyacycaaa...
