wcnt-1.0001c

CORRECTIONS:
	* err no I have n't completely fixed the unexpected end of file
		errors some playback programs emmit.  Shorter files seem ok.

CHANGES:
	* in verbose mode, no more mystery as to what the parameter
		has been set to.
		
ADDITIONS:

	* new command line option --sample-info samplename.wav
		surprisingly, displays .wav header information:
		samplelenght, channels, bitrate. command line options
		are parsed in jwmsynth::scan_cl_options.  Useful to
		know how many samples when setting certain sampler 
		parameters

	* wav header checking is now in place, no longer can you read
		as a sample, any old file you throw at it. Boooo! Down with fascists!

Ok.Ok. I've done it again!  I've released the supposedly
fixed version wcnt-1.0001 without testing it fully. DOH!!

wcnt-1.0001b

FIXES:

	* logic_trigger module:
		now you can specify in_trig2 without it telling
		you it expected in_trig1 (changed second "in_trig1"
		to "in_trig2" inputnames.cc line 43)
		
		no longer reports something about combiner function
		being an invalid parameter type (added missing break 
		statement after line 676 in synthfilereader.cc)

No, I'm not a proffesional.  Yes, this is the first time I've
released software to the outside world.

wcnt-1.0001

FIXES:

	* registered input in_pwm for square_wave properly.
	* registered in_signal input for modifier
	* lpfilter had the wrong parameters registerd
	* osc_clock freq_mod2 now works
	* velocity response time in sequencer
		velocity response times of 0 don't cause velocity 
		to always be 0 anymore.
	* Appear to have corrected unexpected end of file warnings
		which certain playback programs emit.

CHANGES:

	* the various clock modules trigger immediately on 
		starting the first cycle rather than at the end 
		of the first cycle.
		
	* improved frequency modulation code for various clock 
		modules. Now a positive value of 1.0 from input 
		multiplies freq by modsize, and negative value of -1.0
		divides freq by modsize.
		
	* as a result of above, changed osc_clock frequency 
		modulation parameters
	
	* improved user_wave run() code (possibly)
	
	* improved stereo_amp amplitude modulation code to work as 
		expected. (rather than being slightly unfathomable as to 
		what it actually does.)
	
ADDITIONS:

	* added new output out_deg_size to freq_generator
	
NEW MODULES:

	* random_trigger
		if in_trig is on, randomly choose whether to set out_trig to on
		if choice is against randomly choose whether to set out_not_trig
		to on.  Two parameters: probability and not_probability. 0 ~ 1
		
	* logic_trigger
		and/or/xor functions, take two triggers and decide to set 
		out_trig to on or off.
		
	* wcnt_signal
		wrapper for CAT_DOUBLE outputs NOT CAT_SHORT outputs like mix_chan
		
	* switcher
		switches through a unlimited list of wcnt_signals, on trigger 
		switch to next.
	
	* hp_filter
		high pass filter, exactly the same as the lp_filter except it 
		has an extra array to store the original values before doing 
		the low pass thing and then subtracts the low pass from the 
		original.
	
	* combiner
		similiar to mixer except uses wcnt_signal not mix_chan.  No 
		master level, but has mean_total instead, when set to on
		calculates mean average.
