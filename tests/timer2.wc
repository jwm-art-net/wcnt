;
; this test was created while developing new functionality for the
; timer module allowing both relative and absolute times to be
; recycled to allow the timer to loop endlessly.
;
; this stuff can become quite confusing if a timing is not added
; at 0.0 seconds. The timer will output -1 from out_count until
; the first timing is reached and maybe you forget this and wonder
; why some module not set to start until the first timing appears
; to start straight away in the audio file saved - forgetting the
; audio file does not start writing until the first output either.
; doh!
