samplerate 96000

This file is a Wav Composer Not Toilet header file (.wch). A header file
is used to tell wcnt what samplerate is should operate at. By doing this
inside a header file, many .wc files in a group can be updated easily to
a different sample rate without using tools such as sed.

The very first line of a .wch file must specify the sample rate:
samplerate n
Where n is the samplerate to be used, ie 44100, 48000, etc.
